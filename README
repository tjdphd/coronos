Interactive tests:

1.) first edit and make
2.) then qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=2 -I
3.) cd dev/coronos
4.) aprun -n 2 src/coronos


Finding include files:

at the moment I do this by setting CPPFLAGS at configure time.
The user needs to know where the correct path for -I. For example
in the case of fftw on fish this is located in 
/opt/fftw/default/interlagos/include/

so as of this writing when I need to configure I do this:

./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/fftw/default/interlagos/include/' --cache-file=conf.cache

the second option there about cache-file ensures that configure remembers the include path for later reference when reconfiguring. The info is stored in the file named.


I'm at a point now where I really seriously need to be getting this under version control.

just an idea for the name of the project:

CURHO

(CU)DA-ready (R)educed-(H)all (O)r (R)educed- MHD (O)
(N)umerical 

oh never mind...
