0.) get started on instantiation of lcsolve

    the easy part of this is done. the hard part is moving the Loop over to solve.
    I expect to run into FFT issue here. This is probably what's going to occupy 
    me for the next little while.

    I've begun the hard part. So far the adjacent layers business is up and running.
    The next thing on the agenda is updatePAJ which currently resides on the physics
    class. Question: should it stay there? If so, the next step is to add the physic
    class as an argument to the solve class so that updatePAJ can be called from
    solve. Alternatively, maybe using the friend approach will work. 

1.) Review everything

    notes: have gotten to the point where I can get initial conditions correctly whether using
           the calculated mode or the "programmed" mode. Other modes should be disposed of
           and the remaining modes renamed to more intelligent choices.

2.) test kInit. make sure it behaves like rmct2_np for the k's

3.) rename redhallmhd to rhmhd. 

4.) simplication (ie elimination of run_instance and canvas in favor of just a stack)

5.) gpu implementation
