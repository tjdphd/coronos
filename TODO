0.) Scut work ( Low Priority )

*   a.) beautification..................................................ongoing

    b.) I'd really like to disassociate fftw from physics. Seems to me the only way to do this
        is to turn fftw into a namespace instead of a class which physics and solve can "use."
        I feel like I tried something like this once before and ran into trouble though, so
        I'm not sure...

    c.) rename redhallmhd to rhmhd.

    d.) simplication (ie elimination of run_instance in favor of just a canvas with stack)

1.) Priority Development Work

*   a.) start documentation...............................................small steps taken
*   b.) upload to github..................................................Done
*   c.) complete CPU RMHD reproduction including:..........................Done

*       i.) Longcope boundary conditions (based on LiWei's cuda port).......Done
*      ii.) energy, evsz, spectral et al calculations.......................mostly done
*     iii.) recording of vorticity and current density in output.............done
*      iv.) Parker heating test...........................................mostly done

    d.) complete CPU IRMHD addition - In progress

    d.) CPU Hall RMHD including:

        i.) double check current infrastructure
       ii.) update electron inertia portion to reflect correction
      iii.) compare runs neglecting electron inertia against CPU "fourfield" code.

*   e.) commence gpu implementation where possible given progress on other fronts....small steps taken

    f.) profiling / optimizing
 
    g.) portability to other platforms

2.) Related priority Theoretical Work

*   a.) Reproduce Hazeltine 85 and 87 (and 86 if necessary)................In progress
    b.) Use results of a to check current form of four-field model
    c.) check model against Morrison(?) 2010.
    d.) also look for work by Chaston

3.) Wish List

    a.) (non-?)optional Binary - possibly hdf5 output for all data.
    b.) more comprehensive output such as B-field components etc
    c.) the option to output datafiles without having to complete a run first
    d.) an IDL widget application analogous to what I've put together for 
        the hybrid code.
    e.) possible provisions for other graphical post-processing options, particularly
        with Vapor(?) in mind.
