0.) Scut work ( Low Priority )

    a.) beautification

    b.) I'd really like to disassociate fftw from physics. Seems to me the only way to do this
        is to turn fftw into a namespace instead of a class which physics and solve can "use."
        I feel like I tried something like this once before and ran into trouble though, so
        I'm not sure...

    c.) rename redhallmhd to rhmhd.

    d.) simplication (ie elimination of run_instance in favor of just a canvas with stack)

1.) Priority Development Work

    a.) start documentation
    b.) upload to github
    c.) complete CPU RMHD reproduction including:

        i.) Longcope boundary conditions (based on LiWei's cuda port)
       ii.) energy, evsz, spectral et al calculations
      iii.) recording of vorticity and current density in output
       iv.) Parker heating test

    d.) CPU Hall RMHD including:

        i.) double check current infrastructure
       ii.) update electron inertia portion to reflect correction
      iii.) compare runs neglecting electron inertia against CPU "fourfield" code.

    e.) commence gpu implementation where possible given progress on other fronts.

    f.) profiling / optimizing
 
    g.) portability to other platforms

2.) Related priority Theoretical Work

    a.) Reproduce Hazeltine 85 and 87 (and 86 if necessary).
    b.) Use results of a to check current form of four-field model
    c.) check model against Morrison(?) 2010.

3.) Wish List

    a.) (non-?)optional Binary - possibly hdf5 output for all data.
    b.) more comprehensive output such as B-field components etc
    c.) the option to output datafiles without having to compete a run first
    d.) an IDL widget application analogous to what I've put together for 
        the hybrid code.
    e.) possible provisions for other graphical post-processing options, particularly
        with Vapor(?) in mind.
