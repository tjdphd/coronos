0.) Scut work ( Low Priority )

*   a.) beautification..................................................ongoing

    b.) I'd really like to disassociate fftw from physics. Seems to me the only way to do this
        is to turn fftw into a namespace instead of a class which physics and solve can "use."
        I feel like I tried something like this once before and ran into trouble though, so
        I'm not sure...

    c.) rename redhallmhd to rhmhd.

    d.) simplication (ie elimination of run_instance in favor of just a canvas with stack)

1.) Priority Development Work

*   a.) start documentation...............................................small steps taken
*   b.) upload to github..................................................Done
*   c.) complete CPU RMHD reproduction including:..........................Done

*       i.) Longcope boundary conditions (based on LiWei's cuda port).......Done
*      ii.) energy, evsz, spectral et al calculations.......................mostly done
*     iii.) recording of vorticity and current density in output.............done
*      iv.) Parker heating test...........................................mostly done

*   d.) complete CPU IRMHD addition - Done, needs the following testing

11/30/16  NOTES: solve averaging issue related to QtyVsZ and energies
                 run two-run vs one-run tests in trackEn to find problem with inter-run hiccup.

                 after some experiments have reached following tentative conclusions:
                 1.) energy conservation check seems trustworthy for single subrun experiments
                     but some revision of restarts is needed to remove "dimples" in conservation
                     check time series curves. Whatever the problem is seems to lie pretty
                     deeply with the inter-run storage. 
                 2.) barring errors introduced via restarts it appears that decent energy
                     conservation is acheived for parker rmhd,  Gauss rmhd, and Parker inhm,
                     but not for Gauss inhm unless the eenv_zero envelop parameter is significantly
                     reduced. Another question is whether other changes in Gauss parameters could
                     improve the situation. Experiments will have to be done.
                 3.) The restart issue really needs to be addressed first I think. 

        o.) verify sum over z-energies gives volumetric energies.....................................cr, ??_????
        i.) Energy Conservation checks (ECC) for Parker homogeneous RMHD as control..................ec, pk_rmhd
       ii.) Energy Conservation checks (ECC) for Magnetic Reconnection homogeneous RMHD as control...ec, mr_rmhd  
      iii.) ECC very weak Parker inhomogeneity tests.................................................wk, pk_inhm 
       iv.) ECC larger Parker inhomogeneity tests....................................................st, pk_inhm
        v.) ECC incompressible Gaussian homogeneous tests............................................ec, gs_rmhd
       vi.) ECC incompressible Gaussian weak inhomogeneity tests.....................................wk, gs_inhm
      vii.) ECC incompressible Gaussian strong inhomogeity tests.....................................st, gs_inhm
     viii.) optionally, depending on previous outcomes, ECC naive Gaussian tests.....................nv, gs_inhm
       ix.) wave action conservation tests...........................................................wa, ??_inhm

    e.) add logarithmic spectra output, pef, aef, etc....

    f.) CPU Hall RMHD including:

        i.) double check current infrastructure
       ii.) update electron inertia portion to reflect correction
      iii.) compare runs neglecting electron inertia against CPU "fourfield" code.

*   g.) commence gpu implementation where possible given progress on other fronts....small steps taken
    h.) profiling / optimizing
*   i.) portability to other platforms - significant progress made, efforts ongoing.

2.) Related priority Theoretical Work

    a.) Complete derivations for RMHD, IRMHD, connect with other already completed theoretical work. (check Zank and Mattheaus (sp?))
*   b.) Reproduce Hazeltine 85 and 87 (and 86 if necessary)................In progress
    c.) Use results of a to check current form of four-field model
    d.) check model against Morrison(?) 2010.
    e.) also look for work by Chaston

3.) Wish List

    a.) (non-?)optional Binary - possibly hdf5 output for all data.
    b.) more comprehensive output such as B-field components etc
    c.) the option to output datafiles without having to complete a run first
    d.) an IDL widget application analogous to what I've put together for 
        the hybrid code.
    e.) possible provisions for other graphical post-processing options, particularly
        with Vapor(?) in mind.
    f.) field-line tracing through volume - ask Xuan.
