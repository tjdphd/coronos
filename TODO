resolve name similarity between Z arrays and z coordinate arrays

error handling for fetching

a generic fetcher so users don't need to keep track of map names

test that pLinz is really doing what it's supposed to be doing - this may require a tomographic idl script set.

get the random driving going.

get the interior boundary slab exchange going.

get calculation of H-field going

get calculation of Vorticity field going.

k arrays and random r-number arrays should both be vectors for the sake of easy memory management. Do this next so 
you can get on with random driving.

When all initialization-related stuff is complete for the non-cuda case, start in on cuda development up to that point.

The r arrays should be complex with size n1n2c
