; Developed for use with the family of Heliospheric Physics codes originating  ;
; with the work of C.S. Ng and including 'rmct_np,' and 'fourfields,'          ;
; 'rmct2-cuda,' and 'ff-cuda.'                                                 ;
;                                                                              ;
; Description: This is a batch script to be read into an instantiation of IDL  ;
;              running on a login node. The reading in of this script          ;
;              (and the instantiation of IDL on the  node) is                  ;
;              accomplished via the execution of a 'parent' c-shell script     ;
;              called 'cts_idl.s'. Prospective users are forewarned not to try ;
;              'feeding' this script to IDL any other way unless they know     ;
;              what they're doing. Otherwise confusion and frustration are     ;
;              certain to ensue. You're much better off reading the            ;
;              documentation in cts_idl.s first.                               ;
;                                                                              ;
;              The purpose of this script is to execute the IDL procedure      ;
;              'ff_time_series' which, as of this writing, is an interactive   ;
;              procedure used for examining the time-series output for a       ;
;              variety of auxiliary quantities output by the code, most of     ;
;              which are energy-related. A full list awaits further            ;
;              development of the script and its documentation.                ;
;                                                                              ;
